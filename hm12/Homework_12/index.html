		<br> <p>Colombia is the oldest democracy in Latin America, yet has lacked national cohesion since its independence in 1810. This can be attributed several factors including the high concentration of wealth in the hands of a small elite, the nation’s geography as the Andes mountain range acts as a natural barrier to integration, and to a politically polarized environment. The division has resulted in a society divided by class interests, political and economic power, a weak state unable to exercise governance in large areas of the territory, and rural-areas lacking basic infrastructure and economic initiatives </p>

     	 	<h3>Presence of Guerrilla Groups</h3> <p>Colombia has long been affected by guerrilla violence and government military actions in conjunction with governmental efforts for the promotion of dialogue with guerrilla groups to achieve peace. The ownership of most land by less than 5 percent of the population has been a constant source of conflict in Colombia, an example being the ongoing struggle to expand the agricultural frontier . The persistency of the Colombian conflict has left a deep wound in the social structures</p>

     		<div class="col-sm-6">
     	 	<h3>Forced Displacement</h3> <p>The phenome started in the decade of the 1990s with an escalation of the conflict with guerrillas whom had become more violent and initiated practices of terrorism, kidnapping, forced displacements, and attacks on public infrastructure. These were their tools to put pressure on the government and gain power. Meanwhile the Colombian government continued efforts to negotiate peace but all domestic investments were directed at fighting narcotics trafficking.</p>
